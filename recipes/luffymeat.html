    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Meat</li>
        <li>1 large beef ribeye steak (about 2-3 pounds) on the bone</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons tomato ketchup</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon honey</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>3 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
        <li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>    Prepare yourself for an epic meaty adventure! Start by combining the soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, tomato ketchup, honey, Dijon mustard, olive oil, minced garlic, salt, and black pepper in a bowl. Mix them together to create a flavorful marinade that will bring your meat to life.</li>
        <li>    Place the beef ribeye steak on a large platter or in a dish suitable for marinating. Pour the marinade over the meat, making sure to coat it thoroughly. Visualize Luffy's enthusiasm as you generously apply the marinade, allowing it to seep into every inch of the meat.</li>
        <li>    Cover the meat with plastic wrap or place it in a resealable plastic bag, ensuring it is fully sealed. Let it marinate in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours, or even overnight if time allows. During this time, the marinade will work its magic, infusing the meat with its delicious flavors.</li>
        <li>Once the marinating time is complete, it's time to embark on the grilling adventure. Preheat your grill to medium-high heat, preparing it for the feast to come.</li>
        <li>Take the marinated beef ribeye steak out of the dish or bag, allowing any excess marinade to drip off. Place the steak on the preheated grill, directly over the flame or heat source.</li>
        <li>Grill the steak for about 12-15 minutes per side, or until it reaches your desired level of doneness. To ensure even cooking, you can rotate the steak occasionally. Feel the heat beneath you and imagine the sizzling sound as the meat cooks to perfection.</li>
        <li>Once the steak is grilled to your liking, carefully remove it from the grill and transfer it to a cutting board. Allow the meat to rest for a few minutes, giving the juices time to redistribute and settle within the meat.</li>
        <li>Now comes the moment of truth! Serve the whole chunk of meat on the bone on a large platter, just like Luffy enjoys it. Picture the excitement as your guests gather around, ready to sink their teeth into this mighty feast.</li>
        <li>Encourage your guests to tear off chunks of meat from the bone, embracing the spirit of Luffy's adventure. The tender, juicy meat will reward them with incredible flavors and satisfy their inner pirate.</li>
        <li>Accompany the meat with your favorite sides, such as roasted vegetables, mashed potatoes, or a fresh salad. Let your imagination run wild as you create a bountiful spread that captures the essence of a pirate's feast.</li>
        <li>As you indulge in Luffy's Meaty Adventure, celebrate the joy of eating together and the thrill of savoring a truly satisfying and meaty experience!</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Note: Adjust the cooking time according to the thickness of the meat and your preferred level of doneness. Enjoy the meat as a communal meal or adapt the recipe for smaller portions if desired.</p>
