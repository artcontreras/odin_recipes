    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour four 9-inch round cake pans. Prepare yourself for a baking adventure fit for a Yonko!</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Set it aside as the foundation of your cake.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. Imagine yourself wielding the power of a Yonko, blending the ingredients with incredible strength!</li>
        <li>Add the eggs to the butter and sugar mixture, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Feel the power of your mixer as you create a smooth and creamy batter, fit for a grand wedding celebration.</li>
        <li>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the batter, alternating with the milk. Begin and end with the dry ingredients. Mix until just combined, making sure not to overmix. This will ensure a moist and tender cake.</li>
        <li>Stir in the vanilla extract, infusing your creation with a touch of elegance. Marvel at the aroma as it fills the room.</li>
        <li>Divide the batter equally among the prepared cake pans. Smooth the tops with a spatula, giving them a polished appearance. It's time to create towering cake layers fit for an emperor!</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Allow the cakes to cool in the pans for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Patience is key, as you want your layers to be firm and ready for stacking.</li>
        <li>While the cake layers are cooling, it's time to prepare the frosting. In a large bowl, beat the softened butter until creamy. Gradually add the confectioners' sugar, heavy cream, and vanilla extract. Continue to beat until the frosting is light and fluffy. If desired, divide the frosting into bowls and add food coloring to create a vibrant and festive palette.</li>
        <li>Once the cake layers have cooled, it's time to assemble your masterpiece. Place one cake layer on a serving plate and generously spread frosting on top. Repeat with the remaining layers, creating a tower of moist cake and creamy frosting. Ensure each layer is level and aligned, creating a stable structure.</li>
        <li>Now, it's time for the grand finale—decorating the cake. Roll out the fondant into thin sheets and drape it gracefully over the cake, covering the sides and top. Let your creativity shine as you sculpt the fondant into intricate designs, perhaps mimicking Big Mom's iconic hat or adding delicate floral patterns. Adorn the cake with edible gold flakes, pearls, and any other decorative elements you desire. Allow your imagination to run wild!</li>
    </ol>

    <p>For an extra touch, consider adding edible flowers as a nod to Big Mom's love for them. They will add a pop.</p>
